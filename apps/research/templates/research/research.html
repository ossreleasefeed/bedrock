    <dt>Emscripten</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Emscripten is an open source optimizing compiler for LLVM applications that generates pure JavaScript to run directly on the web. Emscripten makes it possible to take C and C++ programs and convert them automatically to open web applications with no plugins or extensions.</p>
      <p>Emscripten demonstrates that the web is capable of supporting the responsive, real-time user experiences of interactive desktop software, including games, simulations, and even live video decoding. Many applications run within an order of magnitude of their native binary performance. At the same time, Emscripten serves to diagnose and address performance bottlenecks in the web platform, to keep pushing the boundaries of tomorrow’s web.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Rust</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Rust is a new programming language for developing reliable and efficient systems. Rust is designed to support concurrency and parallelism, for building platforms that take full advantage of modern hardware. Its static type system is safe and expressive, and provides strong guarantees about isolation, concurrency execution, and memory safety.</p>
      <p>Rust combines powerful and flexible modern programming constructs with a clear performance model to make program efficiency predictable and manageable. One important way it achieves this is by allowing fine-grained control over memory allocation through contiguous records and stack allocation. This control is balanced with the absolute requirement of safety: Rust’s type system and runtime guarantee the absence of buffer overflow, stack overflow, or access to uninitialized or deallocated memory.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Servo</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Servo is an experimental project to build a web browser engine designed for a new generation of hardware: mobile devices, multi-core processors, and high-performance GPU’s. With Servo we are rethinking the browser at every level of the technology stack--from input parsing to page layout and graphics rendering--to optimize for power efficiency and maximum parallelism.</p>
      <p>Servo builds on top of Rust to provide a secure and reliable foundation. Memory safety at the core of the platform ensures a high degree of assurance in the browser’s trusted computing base. Rust’s lightweight task mechanism also promises to allow fine-grained isolation between browser components such as tabs and extensions without the need for expensive runtime protection schemes like operating system process isolation.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Shumway</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Following on the success of <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pdfjs/">pdf.js</a>, a high-fidelity PDF renderer written in pure HTML and JavaScript, the Shumway project aims to implement an emulator for the Flash™ multimedia platform. Shumway combines rendering techniques pioneered by the open source <a href="https://github.com/tobeytailor/gordon">Gordon</a> emulator with a just-in-time (JIT) compiler for the Actionscript Virtual Machine that generates optimized JavaScript.</p>
      <p>Shumway’s primary goals are to demonstrate the power and expressiveness of the HTML5 platform, as well as to discover and remedy gaps in the web platform.</p>
